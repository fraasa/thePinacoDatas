We observe a peak in active accounts at ages 46-50 for both genders, indicating heightened *banking engagement in midlife*. Males generally have more active accounts than females, but the difference lessens around the age of 56-60. Closed accounts slightly increase around ages 46-50 but do not show a significant rise with age. The distribution of active accounts is slightly right-skewed, suggesting a **near-normal distribution** with a decrease in activity after age 50, reflecting fewer active accounts among older customers.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Plotting the number of active and closed accounts by age and gender
age_ranges = c("01-05","06-10","11-15","16-20","21-25","26-30","31-35","36-40","41-45","46-50","51-55","56-60","61-65","66-70","71-75","76-80","81-85","86-90","91-95","96-100")

Here we use stacked bar charts to explore potential correlations between the months an account has been open (`months_on_book_bin`), the account status (`Closed_Account`), and the card type (`Card_Category`). Our goal is to statistically determine if these variables have a significant relationship and whether they influence account activity. The charts generated help us visually represent the trends based on the card type, thus we can observe:

* for the *Blue Card*, the distribution of active accounts shows a peak around the 37-42 months interval; this suggests a mode of account activity indicating customer retention within this timeframe; the relatively flat distribution of closed accounts implies that most accounts tend to remain active over time. 
* *Silver Card* accounts as well show a spike in activity within the same range and then drop off; the number of closed accounts seems consistent, indicating a turnover around two years. 
* looking at the *Gold Card* we can see a peak in active accounts around 37-42 months, just like the Blue and Silver Card. 
* *Platinum Card* accounts are fewer overall, with a peak in the number of total accounts between 31-42 months, while showing less fluctuation in activity, maintaining a steady number of closed accounts.

In general, active cards outnumber closed ones in time, with account activity peaking at 37-42 phase followed by a gradual decline, meaning a longer retention rate. The first three types of cards present a **near normal distribution graph**, slightly left skewed, while the Platinum card has two observable spikes, both in active and closed accounts, showing that most clients sign during the peak of their career.

The *Blue card* is unsurprisingly the most common (93.2% share), followed by the *Silver card* (5.4% share), the *Gold* (1.2% share) and the *Platinum* (0.2% share). There is a **weak positive correlation** between the months on books and the type of card.

The graph demonstrates that the percentage of closed accounts in relation to total accounts exhibits a slight *dependency on income* levels. There's a substantial drop in active accounts past the \$50,000 mark, while closed accounts reduce at a slower rate. The middle-income range between \$45,000 and \$120,000 shows a lower ratio of closed to total accounts, indicating more stable account activity in this bracket. The most accounts are concentrated in the \$50,000 to \$75,000 income range, and beyond \$120,000, total accounts become much rarer.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

Bank accounts are divided by their *total revolving balance* and categorized based on account status - either closed or active - incrementing ranges by \$26 to formula the bins. Grouping the *number of accounts* within each bin, allows to visualize the *distribution patterns* across the balance variety. The following plot highlights the concentration of accounts around the median (going towards higher values) and reveals a notable spike at the higher end of the balance scale, possibly indicating outliers. The graph also shows a higher number of active accounts compared to closed accounts, suggesting a **positive correlation** between the total revolving balance and account activity.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Analyzing the number of clients based on the number of contacts count distribution for open and closed accounts

The graph illustrates the distribution of accounts based on the *average utilization ratio*, which is the proportion of the *total revolving balance* to the *credit limit*. The utilization ratio is divided into bins of 10, and the number of accounts in each bin is calculated. The plot shows a higher number of active accounts compared to closed accounts, indicating a **positive correlation** between the utilization ratio and account activity. The distribution of active accounts is *right-skewed*, with a peak around the 10-20% utilization ratio, while the distribution of closed accounts is relatively *flat*, suggesting that most accounts remain active regardless of the utilization ratio.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Analyzing the number of clients based on the total transaction amount distribution for open and closed accounts

# Set the ranges for the utilization ratio

Bank accounts are divided by their *total transaction count*, with the bins incremented by three transactions to categorize the accounts. The plot visualizes the *distribution patterns* of the number of accounts across varying transaction volumes. It reveals a prominent spike right at the median, suggesting a common *transactional behavior* among clients. Toward the higher transaction counts, there's a significant drop off, which may point to outliers or less frequent high-volume transactors. Notably, the graph indicates a higher number of active accounts in most transaction ranges, implying **positive correlation** between transaction activity and the likelihood of an account being active.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Analyzing the number of clients based on the total transaction count distribution for open and closed accounts

The graph illustrates the distribution of accounts based on the number of *inactive months*, categorized as either active or closed. The plot shows a higher number of active accounts compared to closed accounts, indicating a **positive correlation** between the number of inactive months and account activity. The distribution of active accounts is *right-skewed*, with a peak around 2 inactive months, while the distribution of closed accounts is relatively *flat*, suggesting that most accounts remain active regardless of the number of inactive months.

The boxplot compares the *income distribution* between active and closed accounts. The plot shows that the median income for active accounts is higher than that for closed accounts, suggesting a **positive correlation** between income and account activity. The income distribution for active accounts is *right-skewed*, with a peak around the median income, while the income distribution for closed accounts is relatively *flat*, indicating that most accounts remain active regardless of income level.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a boxplot to compare the income distribution between closed and active accounts
cleaned_bank_accounts_train$Closed_Account <- factor(cleaned_bank_accounts_train$Closed_Account, 
                                                    levels = c(0, 1),
                                                    labels = c("Active", "Closed"))

# Plot the boxplot with corrected labels
boxplot(Income ~ Closed_Account,  data = cleaned_bank_accounts_train, 
                                  col = c("lightgreen", "salmon"), 
                                  xlab = "Account Status", 
                                  ylab = "Income (thousands dollars)",
                                  main = "Income Distribution by Account Status")

# If necessary, set the x-axis labels explicitly to "Active" and "Closed"
axis(1, at = c(1, 2), labels = c("Active", "Closed"))
```
In conclusion, the data analysis demonstrates that account activity is related to demographic factors like age and income, as well as account features like the type of card, balance, utilization ratio, transaction count, and inactive months.
The predominant number of active accounts compared to closed accounts indicates the data is unbalanced, which may affect the performance of predictive models.

The **logistic regression model** is used to predict the probability of an account being closed based on the *income* of the account holder. The model is fitted using the `glm()` function with the *binomial family* and *logit link* function. The summary of the model provides information about the coefficients and significance levels of the predictors. The plot shows the effect of income on the probability of account closure, with income on the x-axis and the probability of account closure on the y-axis, demonstrating how the probability of account closure increases with higher income levels.

\titleline{GENDER AND INCOME}

As seen before, we are now using logistic regression to look into the relationship between the **probability of account closure** and two predictors: *income* and *gender*. Logistic regression is particularly suited in modeling *binary outcomes*(0 when active, 1 when closed) by estimating probabilities with a logistic function. Including income and gender as independent variables, and their interaction term, we can assess the impact of a person's income and gender on the likelihood of closing their account and whether the income has a different influence for different genders.

The summary gives us coefficients for income, gender, and the interaction between them, indicating how a unit change in these predictors alters the *log odds* of an account being closed, while keeping all other variables unchanged.

The plotted curve, visually represents the probability of account closure coming from predictions for a range of *income across gender groups*.

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model with gender and income as regressors
logit_model <- glm(Closed_Account ~ Income * Gender, 
                   data = cleaned_bank_accounts_train, 
                   family = binomial(link = "logit"))

                         length.out = 100))
gender_levels <- levels(fact_bank_accounts_train$Gender)

## KNN

The graphs illustrate the performance of the **k-NN model** based on the *misclassification error* and the *Area Under the Curve (AUC)* for both the training and validation sets. The plots show the misclassification error and AUC values for different values of k. The best value of k is determined based on the minimum misclassification error and the maximum AUC on the validation set.

The best one based on the misclassification error is calculated by finding the k value that minimizes the misclassification error (7) on the validation set, while similarly, the best one based on the AUC is determined by finding the k value that maximizes the AUC on the validation set (20).

By applying the *elbow rule*, we observe that past these optimal values, additional increases in k do not substantially enhance the model's discriminative power. This ensures that the identified values of k best encapsulate the trade-off between model complexity and generalizability.

## FINDING THE BEST MODELS

We focused on the predictive modeling of closed bank accounts using logistic regression, appropriate for binary outcomes. The initial phase revolves around *data preprocessing*, where irrelevant or non-predictive variables (like `CLIENTNUM`, `Education_Level`, and `Marital_Status`) get removed to prepare the dataset.

In the next steps data is divided into *training* and *validation* sets, hightlighting the importance of cross-validation in assessing model applicability to data. Using various logistic regression models, each employing different variable selection techniques (forward, backward, and bidirectional), implies the necessary balance between *simplicity* and *precision in forecasts*. This takes us to choosing a model that lets us avoid excess complexity and is accurate enough when predicting outcomes. 
For this purpose, the *Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)* and the *Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)* are leveraged to select the best model based on the lowest value of the respective criterion. The selected model is then evaluated using the *Area Under the Curve (AUC)* metric, providing a comprehensive measure of model performance across different classification thresholds and considering both *sensitivity* and *specificity* in binary classification, especially important when the costs of false positives (wrong prediction of account closure) and false negatives (failed prediction of account closure) are varying so much.

In the end, we then select the optimal model based on the *highest AUC value*, applying it to the test dataset to generate predictive probabilities of account closure, generating the predictive probabilities csv file: it is the `aic1 with AUC of 0.9161982`.

In the context of an imbalanced dataset where the class of interest (closed accounts) is the minority class, optimizing for sensitivity is crucial. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate or recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model (the accounts that were correctly predicted to close). This focus is essential because missing out on identifying an account that will close (a false negative) is costlier than incorrectly predicting that an account will close (a false positive). High sensitivity ensures the bank can proactively retain these customers, avoiding a potential loss for each customer who leaves.

â¢	Threshold of 0.5 yields decent accuracy but falls short in maximizing financial gain due to moderate sensitivity.
â¢	Threshold of 0.2 boosts sensitivity, catching more customers who might leave, but also increases false positives, where offers are made to customers who would stay regardless.
â¢	Threshold of 0.8 sharply decreases sensitivity, reducing potential gains significantly.
â¢	Threshold of 0.28 strikes the best balance, leading to the highest financial gain by achieving a good balance between sensitivity and precision.

The ROC curve and the AUC value of 0.916 confirm the model's strong discriminative ability. The curve well above the baseline indicates a good separation between the true positive and false positive rates across various thresholds, affirming the reliability of the model in differentiating between the customers who will close their accounts and those who will not.

In conclusion, the model performs well across all thresholds, but the best financial outcome is achieved at a threshold of 0.28, where the balance between sensitivity and the financial implications of intervention (incentives offered versus customer retention) is optimal.
